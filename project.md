# Waddle API - Book Management System

## Short Description
A scalable, high-performance RESTful API for book management and review systems, featuring JWT authentication, async processing, and distributed task queues.

## Detailed Description

**Waddle API** is a production-ready book management platform built with modern Python technologies, designed to handle high-throughput operations while maintaining security and scalability. The system enables users to manage personal book collections, write reviews, categorize books with tags, and interact through a comprehensive authentication system.

The application demonstrates advanced backend development patterns including asynchronous programming, distributed task processing, and enterprise-grade security implementations. It features a complete user management system with email verification, password reset functionality, and role-based access control.
